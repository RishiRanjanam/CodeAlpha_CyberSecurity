## 🧩 Completed Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 1: Basic Network Sniffer
📁 Folder: `Task1_BasicNetworkSniffer/`  
A Python-based packet sniffer using the `scapy` library that captures and analyzes 10 network packets. It prints key details such as IP addresses, protocols (TCP/UDP), and port numbers.

🔧 **Key Features**:
- Captures live packets from your network interface
- Identifies IP, TCP, and UDP headers
- Simple and educational implementation using Python

### ✅ Task 2: Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
📁 Folder: `Task2_NetworkIntrusionSystem/`  
A lightweight NIDS implementation using open-source tools like **Snort** or **Suricata**. The project includes configuration of custom rules, real-time monitoring of traffic, and generation of alerts for suspicious activity.

🔧 **Key Features**:
- Rule-based packet inspection
- Alerts for port scans, suspicious IPs, malformed packets
- Can be extended with visualization tools like Kibana

🔧 **Key Features**:
- Static analysis without tools
- Remediation advice for insecure practices
- OWASP-inspired checklist reference
